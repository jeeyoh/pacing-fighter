# Pacing Fighter

Pacing Fighter is a 2D Brawler built in Unity C#. It serves as a simulation environment for analyzing game pacing in combat games.

### Custom Combat Engine

Pacing Fighter features a custom combat framework, allowing developers to create new characters and combat moves in a custom editor.

### Steering Behaviours

The enemy AI is controlled through steering behaviours (Craig Reynolds, 1999). These algorithms allow NPCs to adequately react to their surroundings and their neighbouring enemies, cooperating with allies and avoiding obstacles accordingly.

### Recognition
The project was awarded first place at McGill's 2015 Undergraduate Computer Science Projects.
