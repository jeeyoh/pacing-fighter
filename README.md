# Pacing Fighter

Pacing Fighter is a 2D Brawler built in Unity C#. It serves as a simulation environment for analyzing dramatic game pacing in combat games.

### Custom Combat Engine

A custom combat framework was implemented for the project, allowing developers to easily create new characters and combat moves.

### Steering Behaviours

The enemy AI was controlled using steering behaviours (Craig Reynolds, 1999). This AI strategy allows NPCs to adequately react to their surroundings and their neighbouring enemies, avoiding obstacles accordingly.

### Recognition
The projected was awarded first place at McGill's 2015 Undergraduate Computer Science Projects.
