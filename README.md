Pacing Fighter features a custom combat framework, allowing developers to create new characters and combat moves in a custom editor.

### Maze Generator

Mazes are randomly generated using a custom maze editor, allowing entire levels to be created on-the-fly.

### Steering Behaviours

The enemy AI is controlled through steering behaviours (Craig Reynolds, 1999). These algorithms allow NPCs to adequately react to their surroundings and their neighbouring enemies, cooperating with allies and avoiding obstacles accordingly.
